# Pseudocode

#### Add the steps you need to take to implement the requirements for Scrabble Challenge

```
1. //1. Attribute numbers to the letters in the scrabble as an array with each class of array representing different class values.. eg.
Function  scrabble = {
    4: ['A', 'E', 'I', 'S', 'T']
    11: ['D', 'G']    
};

2. Set the total score from zero.

3. Sum up the values on your string that corresponds to a word.

4. Use your IF statement to associate the letters to the number values and console.log() the length of your string to confirm numbers match letters output. 

5. If the letter is found in the letterScores object, add its score to the total e.g. d.o.g and the output should be the sum of the value of those letters (5).

...etc
