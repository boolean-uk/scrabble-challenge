# Scrabble Challenge

Welcome to the Scrabble challenge!

## Learning Objectives
- Build a simple program using functions, loops, and conditional statements
- Use `git` & GitHub to commit work and open a Pull Request

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository and then:
```sh
git clone [your repo] && cd js-scrabble-challenge
npm ci # installs dependencies listed in package.json
```
2. Run the tests from your project root directory. There should be a lot of failures to begin with. You can run your test suite in a few ways:
```sh
npm test
# or
npx jasmine
# or run jasmine directly
./node_modules/jasmine/bin/jasmine.js
```
3. In GitHub, [open a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from your forked repository to the challenge repository.
4. Implement the criteria below locally and [push your code](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line) to your repository! Every push to a branch that has an open Pull Request will update it automatically with your changes.
5. Check the status of the automated tests on the Pull Request - update your implementation if needed.

# Task

Given a word, compute the scrabble score for that word.

##### Letter Values

You'll need these:

| Letter                        | Value  |
| ----                          |  ----  |
| A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T  |     1  |
| D, G                          |     2  |
| B, C, M, P                    |     3  |
| F, H, V, W, Y                 |     4  |
| K                             |     5  |
| J, X                          |     8  |
| Q, Z                          |     10 |

Example
"cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:

- 3 points for C
- 1 point for A, twice
- 3 points for B, twice
- 2 points for G
- 1 point for E

And to total:

```
3 + 2x1 + 2x3 + 2 + 1
= 3 + 2 + 6 + 3
= 14
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```js
scrabble('') // should return 0

scrabble(" \t\n") // should return 0

scrabble(null) // should return 0

scrabble('a') // should return 1

scrabble('f') // should return 4

scrabble('street') // should return 6

scrabble('quirky') // should return 22

scrabble('OXYPHENBUTAZONE') // should return 41
```

## Extended Acceptance Criteria

For some of the extended criteria, you may need to look up functions and techniques you have not used before.

You need to complete both of these features to pass the Extended Acceptance Criteria.

There are tests for both of these features -- you can run these using in terminal: `npm run test-extensions`. The spec file is located in `spec/extensions/scrabble.spec.js`.

### Double and Triple Letter
Your solution should support the ability to define specific letters as double and triple score. Letters that count as double are enclosed in a pair of curly brackets `{}` - for example, the letter `o` would be defined as a double letter in in the word dog like this: `d{o}g`. Triple letters are enclosed in a set of square brackets - for example: `d[o]g`. Your solution should detect these brackets and apply the correct score modifications.

### Double or Triple Word
Similar to above, your solution should support the ability to define double and triple word scores. To indicate a double word score, the submitted word will be enclose in a pair of curly brackets (for example `{dog}`), and for triple word score a pair of square brackets (`[dog]`). Your solution should detect these brackets and apply the correct score modifications.

### Concise Code
Split up your `scrabble` function in to multiple smaller functions that do one thing only. Read this [article on Clean Functions](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript#functions) and apply the principles you think are relevant.
