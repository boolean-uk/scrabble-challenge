# Pseudocode

#### Add the steps you need to take to implement the requirements for Scrabble Challenge

```
1. define a function to calculate the scrabble score for any given word by calling it with the word as the argument

2.Define a dictionary where each letter maps to its specified value.

3. Convert the input word to uppercase to ensure case-sensitivity.

4. Iterate through each character in the word, summing the values based to get total score.

5. Handle cases like empty strings, whitespace, or invalid inputs (like null) by returning a score of 0 etc.

...etc
```
