input: word
output: score

1: Think about where to store the points values- object would make sense

2: Build the function- takes in word/string

3: Guard clause- return 0 if there is no word (!word) and if there is any empty spaces detected (trim)

4: Create a new variable that will hold array of the word- force everything to lower case and then split into array

5: Declare score variable that holds 0 for now

6: Use forEach on array- for each letter, we access the points object and add to the score

7: return the score

8: Extension functions could come before the final return statement (more later)
